            Laying in the silence <br>
            Waiting for the sirens <br>
            Signs, any signs I'm alive still <br>
            I don't wanna lose it <br>
            But I'm not getting through this <br>
            Hey, should I pray? Should I pray, yeah <br>
            To myself? To a God? <br>
            To a savior who can <br>

            Unbreak the broken <br>
            Unsay these spoken words <br>
            Find hope in the hopeless <br>
            Pull me out of the train wreck <br>
            Unburn the ashes <br>
            Unchain the reactions, <br> I'm not ready to die, not yet <br>
            Pull me out of the train wreck <br>
            Pull me out, pull me out,  <br>pull me out, ah <br>
            Pull me out, pull me out <br>

            Underneath our bad blood <br>
            We've still got a sanctum, home <br>
            Still a home, still a home here <br>
            It's not too late to build it back <br>
            'Cause a one-in-a-million chance <br>
            Is still a chance, still a chance <br>
            And I would take those odds <br>
